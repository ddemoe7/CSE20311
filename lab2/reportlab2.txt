My program from the ASCII Art Graph is based off of the "y" coordinate of each
x, where the y = the amount of hashes.
The user is not able to input anything however, because the assignment did not
say to include these features.

The program first initializes and declares its variables as a float type.
Then for the ymax and ymin variables, I used values from the library
"climits". The ymax has the lowest number possible and vice versa, b/c the
program eventually compares each value and the greater value is taken for
the ymax, and vice versa for the ymin.

For the nested-for loop, it increments and evaluates y, which sets the amount
of printed #'s. It also will check whether to set a new ymax or ymin.

I verified that the output was correct by comparing the ymax, ymin, xmax, and
xmin values to the values in the table before. They matched.
