My program is meant to give the user information about specific records about
our football seasons from 1900 to 2015. The user will look at a menu that
shows them a variety of information, and thus pick accordingly.

I evaluated the program for correctness by adding in cases where it would be
outside the years range, and I also tested that if the user inputs other
numbers for the calculator, that the calculator would just repeat.

I made sure to verify results, by picking a specific year and made sure that
the win, loss record followed through with the information.
