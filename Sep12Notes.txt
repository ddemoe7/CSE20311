Functions, Prototype/Signature, Linking other code

1. Functions
Ultimate goal: To get/produce a result
Calling of a function IS a value (in most cases)
Functions returns a value assigned to a variable,
NOT like y = f(x). f(x) does whatever and returns a value to be assigned to y

2. Prototype/Signature
First line of func def
Variables declared inside function are LOCAL
Arguments are passed by values
Put function before main func (For this class)
No need to put variables in prototype

3. Modify copy
Give location of document
