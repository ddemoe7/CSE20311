Void in Func

1) Void in Func
No need for a return
A function can be void, but still take arguments
Also possible to have void arguments, but still take data

2) Sentinel Value
Data that you know, would never be part of the data
Add data at the end of the program that terminates the program

for ex: if you know that 999 will never be in the condition
for (1 to 4 or whatever)

if 999 <-- the sentinel value
end
